For controlling the turtlebot via ROS 1 on my computer.

All code written will perform the following functions:

1) Test code for custom messages
  a) hearing key commands and sending those to the robot
  b) custom message commands for turn rate and velocity and how to send those to the robot

2) Code for interfacing with the MAGICC Lab code Grant Stagg is writing
