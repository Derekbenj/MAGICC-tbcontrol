For controlling the turtlebot via ROS 1 on my computer.

All that needs to be done to create an effective workspace is pull this code, and then move into the workspace titled "control_testing" and type "catkin_make". An extra folder exists above the workspace folder only for purposes of holding other test code such as the arduino code.

Current State:
1) Arduino code works almost perfectly: we could create an offset for measuring the room a little better.
